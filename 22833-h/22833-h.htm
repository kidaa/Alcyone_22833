<h3><a name='p1' id='p1'>ALCYONE</a></h3>

<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>In the silent depth of space,</p>
<p>Immeasurably old, immeasurably far,</p>
<p>Glittering with a silver flame</p>
<p>Through eternity,</p>
<p>Rolls a great and burning star,</p>
<p>With a noble name,</p>
<p class='in2em'>Alcyone!</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>In the glorious chart of heaven</p>
<p>It is marked the first of seven;</p>
<p>'Tis a Pleiad:</p>
<p>And a hundred years of earth</p>
<p>With their long-forgotten deeds have come and gone,</p>
<p>Since that tiny point of light,</p>
<p>Once a splendour fierce and bright,</p>
<p>Had its birth</p>
<p>In the star we gaze upon.</p>
</div>

<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;2]</span>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>It has travelled all that time&#8212;</p>
<p>Thought has not a swifter flight&#8212;</p>
<p>Through a region where no faintest gust</p>
<p>Of life comes ever, but the power of night</p>
<p>Dwells stupendous and sublime,</p>
<p>Limitless and void and lonely,</p>
<p>A region mute with age, and peopled only</p>
<p>With the dead and ruined dust</p>
<p>Of worlds that lived eternities ago.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Man! when thou dost think of this,</p>
<p>And what our earth and its existence is,</p>
<p>The half-blind toils since life began,</p>
<p>The little aims, the little span,</p>
<p>With what passion and what pride,</p>
<p>And what hunger fierce and wide,</p>
<p>Thou dost break beyond it all,</p>
<p>Seeking for the spirit unconfined</p>
<p>In the clear abyss of mind</p>
<p>A shelter and a peace majestical.</p>
<p>For what is life to thee,</p>
<p>Turning toward the primal light,</p>
<p>With that stern and silent face,</p>
<p>If thou canst not be</p>
<p>Something radiant and august as night,</p>
<p>Something wide as space?</p>
</div>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;3]</span>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Therefore with a love and gratitude divine</p>
<p>Thou shalt cherish in thine heart for sign</p>
<p>A vision of the great and burning star,</p>
<p>Immeasurably old, immeasurably far,</p>
<p>Surging forth its silver flame</p>
<p>Through eternity;</p>
<p>And thine inner heart shall ring and cry</p>
<p>With the music strange and high,</p>
<p>The grandeur of its name</p>
<p class='in2em'>Alcyone!</p>

<h3><a name='p2' id='p2'>IN MARCH</a></h3>

<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>The sun falls warm: the southern winds awake:</p>
<p>The air seethes upward with a steamy shiver:</p>
<p>Each dip of the road is now a crystal lake,</p>
<p>And every rut a little dancing river.</p>
<p>Through great soft clouds that sunder overhead</p>
<p>The deep sky breaks as pearly blue as summer:</p>
<p>Out of a cleft beside the river's bed</p>
<p>Flaps the black crow, the first demure newcomer.</p>
<p>The last seared drifts are eating fast away</p>
<p>With glassy tinkle into glittering laces:</p>
<p>Dogs lie asleep, and little children play</p>
<p>With tops and marbles in the sunbare places;</p>
<p>And I that stroll with many a thoughtful pause</p>
<p>Almost forget that winter ever was.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3><a name='p3' id='p3'>THE CITY OF THE END OF THINGS</a></h3>

<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Beside the pounding cataracts</p>
<p>Of midnight streams unknown to us</p>
<p>'Tis builded in the leafless tracts</p>
<p>And valleys huge of Tartarus.</p>
<p>Lurid and lofty and vast it seems;</p>
<p>It hath no rounded name that rings,</p>
<p>But I have heard it called in dreams</p>
<p>The City of the End of Things.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Its roofs and iron towers have grown</p>
<p>None knoweth how high within the night,</p>
<p>But in its murky streets far down</p>
<p>A flaming terrible and bright</p>
<p>Shakes all the stalking shadows there,</p>
<p>Across the walls, across the floors,</p>
<p>And shifts upon the upper air</p>
<p>From out a thousand furnace doors;</p>
</div>

<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;6]</span>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And all the while an awful sound</p>
<p>Keeps roaring on continually,</p>
<p>And crashes in the ceaseless round</p>
<p>Of a gigantic harmony.</p>
<p>Through its grim depths re-echoing</p>
<p>And all its weary height of walls,</p>
<p>With measured roar and iron ring,</p>
<p>The inhuman music lifts and falls.</p>
<p>Where no thing rests and no man is,</p>
<p>And only fire and night hold sway;</p>
<p>The beat, the thunder and the hiss</p>
<p>Cease not, and change not, night nor day.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And moving at unheard commands,</p>
<p>The abysses and vast fires between,</p>
<p>Flit figures that with clanking hands</p>
<p>Obey a hideous routine;</p>
<p>They are not flesh, they are not bone,</p>
<p>They see not with the human eye,</p>
<p>And from their iron lips is blown</p>
<p>A dreadful and monotonous cry;</p>
<p>And whoso of our mortal race</p>
<p>Should find that city unaware,</p>
<p>Lean Death would smite him face to face,</p>
<p>And blanch him with its venomed air:</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;7]</span>
<p>Or caught by the terrific spell,</p>
<p>Each thread of memory snapt and cut,</p>
<p>His soul would shrivel and its shell</p>
<p>Go rattling like an empty nut.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>It was not always so, but once,</p>
<p>In days that no man thinks upon,</p>
<p>Fair voices echoed from its stones,</p>
<p>The light above it leaped and shone:</p>
<p>Once there were multitudes of men,</p>
<p>That built that city in their pride,</p>
<p>Until its might was made, and then</p>
<p>They withered age by age and died.</p>
<p>But now of that prodigious race,</p>
<p>Three only in an iron tower,</p>
<p>Set like carved idols face to face,</p>
<p>Remain the masters of its power;</p>
<p>And at the city gate a fourth,</p>
<p>Gigantic and with dreadful eyes,</p>
<p>Sits looking toward the lightless north,</p>
<p>Beyond the reach of memories;</p>
<p>Fast rooted to the lurid floor,</p>
<p>A bulk that never moves a jot,</p>
<p>In his pale body dwells no more,</p>
<p>Or mind, or soul,&#8212;an idiot!</p>
</div>

<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;8]</span>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>But sometime in the end those three</p>
<p>Shall perish and their hands be still,</p>
<p>And with the master's touch shall flee</p>
<p>Their incommunicable skill.</p>
<p>A stillness absolute as death</p>
<p>Along the slacking wheels shall lie,</p>
<p>And, flagging at a single breath,</p>
<p>The fires shall moulder out and die.</p>
<p>The roar shall vanish at its height,</p>
<p>And over that tremendous town</p>
<p>The silence of eternal night</p>
<p>Shall gather close and settle down.</p>
<p>All its grim grandeur, tower and hall,</p>
<p>Shall be abandoned utterly,</p>
<p>And into rust and dust shall fall</p>
<p>From century to century;</p>
<p>Nor ever living thing shall grow,</p>
<p>Or trunk of tree, or blade of grass;</p>
<p>No drop shall fall, no wind shall blow,</p>
<p>Nor sound of any foot shall pass:</p>
<p>Alone of its accursèd state,</p>
<p>One thing the hand of Time shall spare,</p>
<p>For the grim Idiot at the gate</p>
<p>Is deathless and eternal there.</p>

<h3><a name='p4' id='p4'>THE SONG SPARROW</a></h3>

<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Fair little scout, that when the iron year</p>
<p class='in1em'>Changes, and the first fleecy clouds deploy,</p>
<p class='in1em'>Comest with such a sudden burst of joy,</p>
<p>Lifting on winter's doomed and broken rear</p>
<p>That song of silvery triumph blithe and clear;</p>
<p class='in1em'>Not yet quite conscious of the happy glow,</p>
<p class='in1em'>We hungered for some surer touch, and lo!</p>
<p>One morning we awake, and thou art here.</p>
<p>And thousands of frail-stemmed hepaticas,</p>
<p class='in1em'>With their crisp leaves and pure and perfect hues,</p>
<p class='in1em'>Light sleepers, ready for the golden news,</p>
<p>Spring at thy note beside the forest ways&#8212;</p>
<p class='in1em'>Next to thy song, the first to deck the hour&#8212;</p>
<p class='in1em'>The classic lyrist and the classic flower.</p>

<h3><a name='p5' id='p5'>INTER VIAS</a></h3>

<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>'Tis a land where no hurricane falls,</p>
<p>But the infinite azure regards</p>
<p>Its waters for ever, its walls</p>
<p>Of granite, its limitless swards;</p>
<p>Where the fens to their innermost pool</p>
<p>With the chorus of May are aring,</p>
<p>And the glades are wind-winnowed and cool</p>
<p class='in2em'>With perpetual spring;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Where folded and half withdrawn</p>
<p>The delicate wind-flowers blow,</p>
<p>And the bloodroot kindles at dawn</p>
<p>Her spiritual taper of snow;</p>
<p>Where the limits are met and spanned</p>
<p>By a waste that no husbandman tills,</p>
<p>And the earth-old pine forests stand</p>
<p class='in2em'>In the hollows of hills.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>'Tis the land that our babies behold,</p>
<p>Deep gazing when none are aware;</p>
<p>And the great-hearted seers of old</p>
<p>And the poets have known it, and there</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;11]</span>
<p>Made halt by the well-heads of truth</p>
<p>On their difficult pilgrimage</p>
<p>From the rose-ruddy gardens of youth</p>
<p class='in2em'>To the summits of age.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Now too, as of old, it is sweet</p>
<p>With a presence remote and serene;</p>
<p>Still its byways are pressed by the feet</p>
<p>Of the mother immortal, its queen:</p>
<p>The huntress whose tresses, flung free,</p>
<p>And her fillets of gold, upon earth,</p>
<p>They only have honour to see</p>
<p class='in2em'>Who are dreamers from birth.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>In her calm and her beauty supreme,</p>
<p>They have found her at dawn or at eve,</p>
<p>By the marge of some motionless stream,</p>
<p>Or where shadows rebuild or unweave</p>
<p>In a murmurous alley of pine,</p>
<p>Looking upward in silent surprise,</p>
<p>A figure, slow-moving, divine,</p>
<p class='in2em'>With inscrutable eyes.</p>

<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>How deep the April night is in its noon,</p>
<p>The hopeful, solemn, many-murmured night!</p>
<p>The earth lies hushed with expectation; bright</p>
<p>Above the world's dark border burns the moon,</p>
<p>Yellow and large; from forest floorways, strewn</p>
<p>With flowers, and fields that tingle with new birth,</p>
<p>The moist smell of the unimprisoned earth</p>
<p>Comes up, a sigh, a haunting promise. Soon,</p>
<p>Ah, soon, the teeming triumph! At my feet</p>
<p>The river with its stately sweep and wheel</p>
<p>Moves on slow-motioned, luminous, grey like steel.</p>
<p>From fields far off whose watery hollows gleam,</p>
<p>Aye with blown throats that make the long hours sweet,</p>
<p>The sleepless toads are murmuring in their dream.</p>

<p>O differing human heart,</p>
<p>Why is it that I tremble when thine eyes,</p>
<p>Thy human eyes and beautiful human speech,</p>
<p>Draw me, and stir within my soul</p>
<p>That subtle ineradicable longing</p>
<p>For tender comradeship?</p>
<p>It is because I cannot all at once,</p>
<p>Through the half-lights and phantom-haunted mists</p>
<p>That separate and enshroud us life from life,</p>
<p>Discern the nearness or the strangeness of thy paths</p>
<p>Nor plumb thy depths.</p>
<p>I am like one that comes alone at night</p>
<p>To a strange stream, and by an unknown ford</p>
<p>Stands, and for a moment yearns and shrinks,</p>
<p>Being ignorant of the water, though so quiet it is,</p>
<p>So softly murmurous,</p>
<p>So silvered by the familiar moon.</p>

<p>A hoary mist rose up and slowly sheathed</p>
<p>The dripping walls and portal granite-stepped,</p>
<p>And sank into the inner court, and crept</p>
<p>From column unto column thickly wreathed.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>In that dead hour of darkness before dawn,</p>
<p>When hearts beat fainter, and the hands of death</p>
<p>Are strengthened,&#8212;with lips white and drawn</p>
<p>And feverish lids and scarcely moving breath,</p>
<p>The hapless mother, tender Chione,</p>
<p>Beside the earth-cold figure of her child,</p>
<p>After long bursts of weeping sharp and wild</p>
<p>Lay broken, silent in her agony.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;18]</span>
<p>At first in waking horror racked and bound</p>
<p>She lay, and then a gradual stupor grew</p>
<p>About her soul and wrapped her round and round</p>
<p>Like death, and then she sprang to life anew</p>
<p>Out of a darkness clammy as the tomb;</p>
<p>And, touched by memory or some spirit hand,</p>
<p>She seemed to keep a pathway down a land</p>
<p>Of monstrous shadow and Cimmerian gloom.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>A waste of cloudy and perpetual night&#8212;</p>
<p>And yet there seemed a teeming presence there</p>
<p>Of life that gathered onward in thick flight,</p>
<p>Unseen, but multitudinous. Aware</p>
<p>Of something also on her path she was</p>
<p>That drew her heart forth with a tender cry.</p>
<p>She hurried with drooped ear and eager eye,</p>
<p>And called on the foul shapes to let her pass.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>For down the sloping darkness far ahead</p>
<p>She saw a little figure slight and small,</p>
<p>With yearning arms and shadowy curls outspread,</p>
<p>Running at frightened speed; and it would fall</p>
<p>And rise, sobbing; and through the ghostly sleet</p>
<p>The cry came: 'Mother! Mother!' and she wist</p>
<p>The tender eyes were blinded by the mist,</p>
<p>And the rough stones were bruising the small feet.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;19]</span>
<p>And when she lifted a keen cry and clave</p>
<p>Forthright the gathering horror of the place,</p>
<p>Mad with her love and pity, a dark wave</p>
<p>Of clapping shadows swept about her face,</p>
<p>And beat her back, and when she gained her breath,</p>
<p>Athwart an awful vale a grizzled steam</p>
<p>Was rising from a mute and murky stream,</p>
<p>As cold and cavernous as the eye of death.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And near the ripple stood the little shade,</p>
<p>And many hovering ghosts drew near him, some</p>
<p>That seemed to peer out of the mist and fade</p>
<p>With eyes of soft and shadowing pity, dumb;</p>
<p>But others closed him round with eager sighs</p>
<p>And sweet insistence, striving to caress</p>
<p>And comfort him; but grieving none the less,</p>
<p>He reached her heartstrings with his tender cries.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And silently across the horrid flow,</p>
<p>The shapeless bark and pallid chalklike arms</p>
<p>Of him that oared it, dumbly to and fro,</p>
<p>Went gliding, and the struggling ghosts in swarms</p>
<p>Leaped in and passed, but myriads more behind</p>
<p>Crowded the dismal beaches. One might hear</p>
<p>A tumult of entreaty thin and clear</p>
<p>Rise like the whistle of a winter wind.</p>
</div>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;20]</span>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And still the little figure stood beside</p>
<p>The hideous stream, and toward the whispering prow</p>
<p>Held forth his tender tremulous hands, and cried,</p>
<p>Now to the awful ferryman, and now</p>
<p>To her that battled with the shades in vain.</p>
<p>Sometimes impending over all her sight</p>
<p>The spongy dark and the phantasmal flight</p>
<p>Of things half-shapen passed and hid the plain.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And sometimes in a gust a sort of wind</p>
<p>Drove by, and where its power was hurled,</p>
<p>She saw across the twilight, jarred and thinned,</p>
<p>Those gloomy meadows of the under world,</p>
<p>Where never sunlight was, nor grass, nor trees,</p>
<p>And the dim pathways from the Stygian shore,</p>
<p>Sombre and swart and barren, wandered o'er</p>
<p>By countless melancholy companies.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And farther still upon the utmost rim</p>
<p>Of the drear waste, whereto the roadways led,</p>
<p>She saw in piling outline, huge and dim,</p>
<p>The walled and towerèd dwellings of the dead</p>
<p>And the grim house of Hades. Then she broke</p>
<p>Once more fierce-footed through the noisome press;</p>
<p>But ere she reached the goal of her distress,</p>
<p>Her pierced heart seemed to shatter, and she woke.</p>
</div>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;21]</span>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>It seemed as she had been entombed for years,</p>
<p>And came again to living with a start.</p>
<p>There was an awful echoing in her ears</p>
<p>And a great deadness pressing at her heart.</p>
<p>She shuddered and with terror seemed to freeze,</p>
<p>Lip-shrunken and wide-eyed a moment's space,</p>
<p>And then she touched the little lifeless face,</p>
<p>And kissed it, and rose up upon her knees.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And round her still the silence seemed to teem</p>
<p>With the foul shadows of her dream beguiled&#8212;</p>
<p>No dream, she thought; it could not be a dream,</p>
<p>But her child called for her; her child, her child!&#8212;</p>
<p>She clasped her quivering fingers white and spare,</p>
<p>And knelt low down, and bending her fair head</p>
<p>Unto the lower gods who rule the dead,</p>
<p>Touched them with tender homage and this prayer:</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>O gloomy masters of the dark demesne,</p>
<p>Hades, and thou whom the dread deity</p>
<p>Bore once from earthly Enna for his queen,</p>
<p>Beloved of Demeter, pale Persephone,</p>
<p>Grant me one boon;</p>
<p>'Tis not for life I pray,</p>
<p>Not life, but quiet death; and that soon, soon!</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;22]</span>
<p>Loose from my soul this heavy weight of clay,</p>
<p>This net of useless woe.</p>
<p>O mournful mother, sad Persephone,</p>
<p>Be mindful, let me go!</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>How shall he journey to the dismal beach,</p>
<p>Or win the ear of Charon, without one</p>
<p>To keep him and stand by him, sure of speech?</p>
<p>He is so little, and has just begun</p>
<p>To use his feet</p>
<p>And speak a few small words,</p>
<p>And all his daily usage has been sweet</p>
<p>As the soft nesting ways of tender birds.</p>
<p>How shall he fare at all</p>
<p>Across that grim inhospitable land,</p>
<p>If I too be not by to hold his hand,</p>
<p>And help him if he fall?</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And then before the gloomy judges set,</p>
<p>How shall he answer? Oh, I cannot bear</p>
<p>To see his tender cheeks with weeping wet,</p>
<p>Or hear the sobbing cry of his despair!</p>
<p>I could not rest,</p>
<p>Nor live with patient mind,</p>
<p>Though knowing what is fated must be best;</p>
<p>But surely thou art more than mortal kind,</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;23]</span>
<p>And thou canst feel my woe,</p>
<p>All-pitying, all-observant, all-divine;</p>
<p>He is so little, mother Proserpine,</p>
<p>He needs me, let me go!</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Thus far she prayed, and then she lost her way,</p>
<p>And left the half of all her heart unsaid,</p>
<p>And a great languor seized her, and she lay,</p>
<p>Soft fallen, by the little silent head.</p>
<p>Her numbèd lips had passed beyond control,</p>
<p>Her mind could neither plan nor reason more,</p>
<p>She saw dark waters and an unknown shore,</p>
<p>And the grey shadows crept about her soul.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Again through darkness on an evil land</p>
<p>She seemed to enter but without distress.</p>
<p>A little spirit led her by the hand,</p>
<p>And her wide heart was warm with tenderness.</p>
<p>Her lips, still moving, conscious of one care,</p>
<p>Murmured a moment in soft mother-tones,</p>
<p>And so fell silent. From their sombre thrones</p>
<p>Already the grim gods had heard her prayer.</p>

<p class='in1em'>Of limits where no death or evil fortune fell,</p>
<p>And men lived out long lives in proud content unbroken,</p>
<p class='in1em'>For there no man was rich, none poor, but all were well.</p>
</div>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;40]</span>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And all the earth was common, and no base contriving</p>
<p class='in1em'>Of money of coined gold was needed there or known,</p>
<p>But all men wrought together without greed or striving,</p>
<p class='in1em'>And all the store of all to each man was his own.</p>

<p>From all that busy land, grey town, and peaceful village,</p>
<p class='in1em'>Where never jar was heard, nor wail, nor cry of strife,</p>

<p class='in1em'>Arose the murmur and the kindly hum of life.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>At morning to the fields came forth the men, each neighbour</p>
<p class='in1em'>Hand linked to other, crowned, with wreaths upon their hair,</p>
<p>And all day long with joy they gave their hands to labour,</p>
<p class='in1em'>Moving at will, unhastened, each man to his share.</p>

<p>At noon the women came, the tall fair women, bearing</p>
<p class='in1em'>Baskets of wicker in their ample hands for each,</p>

<p class='in1em'>And blessed them with their lofty beauty and blithe speech.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And when the great day's toil was over, and the shadows</p>
<p class='in1em'>Grew with the flocking stars, the sound of festival</p>

<p class='in1em'>Palace, and paven court, and every rustic hall.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Beside smooth streams, where alleys and green gardens meeting</p>
<p class='in1em'>Ran downward to the flood with marble steps, a throng</p>
<p>Came forth of all the folk, at even, gaily greeting,</p>
<p class='in1em'>With echo of sweet converse, jest, and stately song.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>In all their great fair cities there was neither seeking</p>
<p class='in1em'>For power of gold, nor greed of lust, nor desperate pain</p>
<p>Of multitudes that starve, or, in hoarse anger breaking,</p>
<p class='in1em'>Beat at the doors of princes, break and fall in vain.</p>

<p>The chart of neighbouring souls, the bent and need of others,</p>
<p class='in1em'>Thought only of good deeds, sweet speech, and just return.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And there there was no prison, power of arms, nor palace,</p>
<p class='in1em'>Where prince or judge held sway, for none was needed there;</p>
<p>Long ages since the very names of fraud and malice</p>
<p class='in1em'>Had vanished from men's tongues, and died from all men's care.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And there there were no bonds of contract, deed, or marriage,</p>
<p class='in1em'>No oath, nor any form, to make the word more sure,</p>
<p>For no man dreamed of hurt, dishonour, or miscarriage,</p>
<p class='in1em'>Where every thought was truth, and every heart was pure.</p>
</div>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;43]</span>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>There were no castes of rich or poor, of slave or master,</p>
<p class='in1em'>Where all were brothers, and the curse of gold was dead,</p>
<p>But all that wise fair race to kindlier ends and vaster</p>
<p class='in1em'>Moved on together with the same majestic tread.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And all the men and women of that land were fairer</p>
<p class='in1em'>Than even the mightiest of our meaner race can be;</p>
<p>The men like gentle children, great of limb, yet rarer</p>
<p class='in1em'>For wisdom and high thought, like kings for majesty.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And all the women through great ages of bright living,</p>
<p class='in1em'>Grown goodlier of stature, strong, and subtly wise,</p>
<p>Stood equal with the men, calm counsellors, ever giving</p>
<p class='in1em'>The fire and succour of proud faith and dauntless eyes.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And as I journeyed in that land I reached a ruin,</p>
<p class='in1em'>The gateway of a lonely and secluded waste,</p>
<p>A phantom of forgotten time and ancient doing,</p>
<p class='in1em'>Eaten by age and violence, crumbled and defaced.</p>
</div>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;44]</span>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>On its grim outer walls the ancient world's sad glories</p>
<p class='in1em'>Were recorded in fire; upon its inner stone,</p>
<p>Drawn by dead hands, I saw, in tales and tragic stories,</p>
<p class='in1em'>The woe and sickness of an age of fear made known.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And lo, in that grey storehouse, fallen to dust and rotten,</p>
<p class='in1em'>Lay piled the traps and engines of forgotten greed,</p>
<p>The tomes of codes and canons, long disused, forgotten,</p>
<p class='in1em'>The robes and sacred books of many a vanished creed.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>An old grave man I found, white-haired and gently spoken,</p>
<p class='in1em'>Who, as I questioned, answered with a smile benign,</p>
<p>'Long years have come and gone since these poor gauds were broken,</p>
<p class='in1em'>Broken and banished from a life made more divine.</p>
</div>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;45]</span>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>'But still we keep them stored as once our sires deemed fitting,</p>
<p class='in1em'>The symbol of dark days and lives remote and strange,</p>
<p>Lest o'er the minds of any there should come unwitting</p>
<p class='in1em'>The thought of some new order and the lust of change.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>'If any grow disturbed, we bring them gently hither,</p>
<p class='in1em'>To read the world's grim record and the sombre lore</p>
<p>Massed in these pitiless vaults, and they returning thither,</p>
<p class='in1em'>Bear with them quieter thoughts, and make for change no more.'</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And thence I journeyed on by one broad way that bore me</p>
<p class='in1em'>Out of that waste, and as I passed by tower and town</p>
<p>I saw amid the limitless plain far out before me</p>
<p class='in1em'>A long low mountain, blue as beryl, and its crown</p>
</div>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;46]</span>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Was capped by marble roofs that shone like snow for whiteness,</p>
<p class='in1em'>Its foot was deep in gardens, and that blossoming plain</p>
<p>Seemed in the radiant shower of its majestic brightness</p>
<p class='in1em'>A land for gods to dwell in, free from care and pain.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And to and forth from that fair mountain like a river</p>
<p class='in1em'>Ran many a dim grey road, and on them I could see</p>
<p>A multitude of stately forms that seemed for ever</p>
<p class='in1em'>Going and coming in bright bands; and near to me</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Was one that in his journey seemed to dream and linger,</p>
<p class='in1em'>Walking at whiles with kingly step, then standing still,</p>
<p>And him I met and asked him, pointing with my finger,</p>
<p class='in1em'>The meaning of the palace and the lofty hill.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Whereto the dreamer: 'Art thou of this land, my brother,</p>
<p class='in1em'>And knowest not the mountain and its crest of walls,</p>
<p>Where dwells the priestless worship of the all-wise mother?</p>
<p class='in1em'>That is the hill of Pallas; those her marble halls!</p>
</div>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;47]</span>

<p>'There dwell the lords of knowledge and of thought increasing,</p>
<p class='in1em'>And they whom insight and the gleams of song uplift;</p>
<p>And thence as by a hundred conduits flows unceasing</p>
<p class='in1em'>The spring of power and beauty, an eternal gift.'</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Still I passed on until I reached at length, not knowing</p>
<p class='in1em'>Whither the tangled and diverging paths might lead,</p>
<p>A land of baser men, whose coming and whose going</p>
<p class='in1em'>Were urged by fear, and hunger, and the curse of greed.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>I saw the proud and fortunate go by me, faring</p>
<p class='in1em'>In fatness and fine robes, the poor oppressed and slow,</p>
<p>The faces of bowed men, and piteous women bearing</p>
<p class='in1em'>The burden of perpetual sorrow and the stamp of woe.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And tides of deep solicitude and wondering pity</p>
<p class='in1em'>Possessed me, and with eager and uplifted hands</p>
<p>I drew the crowd about me in a mighty city,</p>
<p class='in1em'>And taught the message of those other kindlier lands.</p>
</div>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;48]</span>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>I preached the rule of Faith and brotherly Communion,</p>
<p class='in1em'>The law of Peace and Beauty and the death of Strife,</p>
<p>And painted in great words the horror of disunion,</p>
<p class='in1em'>The vainness of self-worship, and the waste of life.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>I preached, but fruitlessly; the powerful from their stations</p>
<p class='in1em'>Rebuked me as an anarch, envious and bad,</p>
<p>And they that served them with lean hands and bitter patience</p>
<p class='in1em'>Smiled only out of hollow orbs, and deemed me mad.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And still I preached, and wrought, and still I bore my message,</p>
<p class='in1em'>For well I knew that on and upward without cease</p>
<p>The spirit works for ever, and by Faith and Presage</p>
<p class='in1em'>That somehow yet the end of human life is Peace.</p>

<p>Within the palace court the rounds</p>
<p class='in1em'>Of glare and shadow, day and night,</p>
<p>Went ever with the same dull sounds,</p>
<p class='in3em'>The same dull flight:</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>The motion of slow forms of state,</p>

<p>Sometimes a distant shout of boys</p>

<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;51]</span>

<p>In one red corner of the wall,</p>

<p class='in3em'>The burning plain,</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>As listless as the hour, alone,</p>
<p class='in1em'>The poet by his broken lute</p>
<p>Sat like a figure in the stone,</p>
<p class='in3em'>Dark-browed and mute.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>He saw the heat on the thin grass</p>
<p class='in1em'>Fall till it withered joint by joint,</p>
<p>The shadow on the dial pass</p>

<p>Sometimes with clank of hoofs and cries</p>

<p>As from the darkness of a dream,</p>
<p>And with a smile divine supreme</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;54]</span>
<p>Drew up his mantle fold on fold,</p>

<p>Before the birth and making of the world.</p>

<p>Now being on the eve of death, discharged</p>

<p>I questioned how my soul might best employ</p>
<p>This hand, and this still wakeful flame of mind,</p>
<p>In the brief hours yet left me for their use;</p>
<p>Wherefore have I bethought me of my friend,</p>

<p>Yet wavering in the faith and unconfirmed;</p>
<p>Perchance that I may break into thine heart</p>
<p>Some sorrowful channel for the love divine,</p>
<p>I make this simple record of our proof</p>

<p>Whereof the end already for the most</p>
<p>Is death this day with steadfast faith endured.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>We were in prison many days, close-pent</p>
<p>In the black lower dungeon, housed with thieves</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;80]</span>
<p>And murderers and divers evil men;</p>
<p>So foul a pressure, we had almost died,</p>
<p>Even there, in struggle for the breath of life</p>
<p>Amid the stench and unendurable heat;</p>
<p>Nor could we find each other save by voice</p>
<p>Or touch, to know that we were yet alive,</p>
<p>So terrible was the darkness. Yea, 'twas hard</p>
<p>To keep the sacred courage in our hearts,</p>
<p>When all was blind with that unchanging night,</p>
<p>And foul with death, and on our ears the taunts</p>
<p>And ribald curses of the soldiery</p>
<p>Fell mingled with the prisoners' cries, a load</p>
<p>Sharper to bear, more bitter than their blows.</p>
<p>At first, what with that dread of our abode,</p>
<p>Our sudden apprehension, and the threats</p>
<p>Ringing perpetually in our ears, we lost</p>
<p>The living fire of faith, and like poor hinds</p>
<p>Would have denied our Lord and fallen away.</p>
<p>Even Perpetua, whose joyous faith</p>
<p>Was in the later holier days to be</p>
<p>The stay and comfort of our weaker ones,</p>
<p>Was silent for long whiles. Perchance she shrank</p>
<p>In the mere sickness of the flesh, confused</p>
<p>And shaken by our new and horrible plight&#8212;</p>
<p>The tender flesh, untempered and untried,</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;81]</span>
<p>Not quickened yet nor mastered by the soul;</p>
<p>For she was of a fair and delicate make,</p>
<p>Most gently nurtured, to whom stripes and threats</p>
<p>And our foul prison-house were things undreamed.</p>
<p>But little by little as our spirits grew</p>
<p>Inured to suffering, with clasped hands, and tongues</p>
<p>That cheered each other to incessant prayer,</p>
<p>We rose and faced our trouble: we recalled</p>
<p>Our Master's sacred agony and death,</p>
<p>Setting before our eyes the high reward</p>
<p>Of steadfast faith, the martyr's deathless crown.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>So passed some days whose length and count we lost,</p>
<p>Our bitterest trial. Then a respite came.</p>
<p>One who had interest with the governor</p>
<p>Wrought our removal daily for some hours</p>
<p>Into an upper chamber, where we sat</p>
<p>And held each other's hands in childish joy,</p>
<p>Receiving the sweet gift of light and air</p>
<p>With wonder and exceeding thankfulness.</p>
<p>And then began that life of daily growth</p>
<p>In mutual exaltation and sweet help</p>
<p>That bore us as a gently widening stream</p>
<p>Unto the ocean of our martyrdom.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;82]</span>
<p>Uniting all our feebler souls in one&#8212;</p>
<p>A mightier&#8212;we reached forth with this to God.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Perpetua had been troubled for her babe,</p>
<p>Robbed of the breast and now these many days</p>
<p>Wasting for want of food; but when that change</p>
<p>Whereof I spake, of light and liberty</p>
<p>Relieved the horror of our prison gloom,</p>
<p>They brought it to her, and she sat apart,</p>
<p>And nursed and tended it, and soon the child</p>
<p>Would not be parted from her arms, but throve</p>
<p>And fattened, and she kept it night and day.</p>
<p>And always at her side with sleepless care</p>
<p>Hovered the young Felicitas&#8212;a slight</p>
<p>And spiritual figure&#8212;every touch and tone</p>
<p>Charged with premonitory tenderness,</p>
<p>Herself so near to her own motherhood.</p>
<p>Thus lightened and relieved, Perpetua</p>
<p>Recovered from her silent fit. Her eyes</p>
<p>Regained their former deep serenity,</p>
<p>Her tongue its gentle daring; for she knew</p>
<p>Her life should not be taken till her babe</p>
<p>Had strengthened and outgrown the need of her.</p>
<p>Daily we were amazed at her soft strength,</p>
<p>Her pliant and untroubled constancy,</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;83]</span>
<p>Her smiling, soldierly contempt of death,</p>
<p>Her beauty and the sweetness of her voice.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Her father, when our first few bitterest days</p>
<p>Were over, like a gust of grief and rage,</p>
<p>Came to her in the prison with wild eyes,</p>

<p>You are a Christian? How can any one</p>
<p>Of honoured blood, the child of such as me,</p>
<p>Be Christian? 'Tis an odious name, the badge</p>
<p>Only of outcasts and rebellious slaves!'</p>
<p>And she, grief-touched, but with unyielding gaze,</p>
<p>Showing the fulness of her slender height:</p>
<p>'This vessel, father, being what it is,</p>
<p>An earthen pitcher, would you call it thus?</p>
<p>Or would you name it by some other name?'</p>
<p>'Nay, surely,' said the old man, catching breath,</p>
<p>And pausing, and she answered: 'Nor can I</p>
<p>Call myself aught but what I surely am&#8212;</p>

<p>A special favour to Perpetua</p>

<p>Wherefrom we all, less gifted, sore athirst,</p>
<p>Drank courage and fresh joy; for glowing dreams</p>
<p>Were sent her, full of forms august, and fraught</p>
<p>With signs and symbols of the glorious end</p>
<p>Whereto God's love hath aimed us for Christ's sake.</p>
<p>Once&#8212;at what hour I know not, for we lay</p>
<p>In that foul dungeon, where all hours were lost,</p>
<p>And day and night were indistinguishable&#8212;</p>
<p>We had been sitting a long silent while,</p>
<p>Some lightly sleeping, others bowed in prayer,</p>
<p>When on a sudden, like a voice from God,</p>
<p>Perpetua spake to us and all were roused.</p>
<p>Her voice was rapt and solemn: 'Friends,' she said,</p>
<p>'Some word hath come to me in a dream. I saw</p>
<p>A ladder leading to heaven, all of gold,</p>
<p>Hung up with lances, swords, and hooks. A land</p>
<p>Of darkness and exceeding peril lay</p>
<p>Around it, and a dragon fierce as hell</p>
<p>Guarded its foot. We doubted who should first</p>
<p>Essay it, but you, Saturus, at last&#8212;</p>
<p>So God hath marked you for especial grace&#8212;</p>
<p>Advancing and against the cruel beast</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;85]</span>
<p>Aiming the potent weapon of Christ's name&#8212;</p>
<p>Mounted, and took me by the hand, and I</p>
<p>The next one following, and so the rest</p>
<p>In order, and we entered with great joy</p>
<p>Into a spacious garden filled with light</p>
<p>And balmy presences of love and rest;</p>
<p>And there an old man sat, smooth-browed, white-haired,</p>
<p>Surrounded by unnumbered myriads</p>
<p>Of spiritual shapes and faces angel-eyed,</p>
<p>Milking his sheep; and lifting up his eyes</p>
<p>He welcomed us in strange and beautiful speech,</p>
<p>Unknown yet comprehended, for it flowed</p>
<p>Not through the ears, but forth-right to the soul,</p>
<p>God's language of pure love. Between the lips</p>
<p>Of each he placed a morsel of sweet curd;</p>
<p>And while the curd was yet within my mouth,</p>
<p>I woke, and still the taste of it remains,</p>
<p>Through all my body flowing like white flame,</p>
<p>Sweet as of some immaculate spiritual thing.'</p>
<p>And when Perpetua had spoken, all</p>
<p>Were silent in the darkness, pondering,</p>
<p>But Saturus spake gently for the rest:</p>
<p>'How perfect and acceptable must be</p>
<p>Your soul to God, Perpetua, that thus</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;86]</span>
<p>He bends to you, and through you speaks his will.</p>
<p>We know now that our martyrdom is fixed,</p>
<p>Nor need we vex us further for this life.'</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>While yet these thoughts were bright upon our souls,</p>
<p>There came the rumour that a day was set</p>
<p>To hear us. Many of our former friends,</p>
<p>Some with entreaties, some with taunts and threats,</p>
<p>Came to us to pervert us; with the rest</p>
<p>Again Perpetua's father, worn with care;</p>
<p>Nor could we choose but pity his distress,</p>
<p>So miserably, with abject cries and tears,</p>
<p>He fondled her and called her 'Domina,'</p>
<p>And bowed his agèd body at her feet,</p>
<p>Beseeching her by all the names she loved</p>
<p>To think of him, his fostering care, his years,</p>
<p>And also of her babe, whose life, he said,</p>
<p>Would fail without her; but Perpetua,</p>
<p>Sustaining by a gift of strength divine</p>
<p>The fulness of her noble fortitude,</p>
<p>Answered him tenderly: 'Both you and I,</p>
<p>And all of us, my father, at this hour</p>
<p>Are equally in God's hands, and what he wills</p>
<p>Must be'; but when the poor old man was gone</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;87]</span>
<p>She wept, and knelt for many hours in prayer,</p>
<p>Sore tried and troubled by her tender heart.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>One day, while we were at our midday meal,</p>
<p>Our cell was entered by the soldiery,</p>
<p>And we were seized and borne away for trial.</p>
<p>A surging crowd had gathered, and we passed</p>
<p>From street to street, hemmed in by tossing heads</p>
<p>And faces cold or cruel; yet we caught</p>
<p>At moments from masked lips and furtive eyes</p>
<p>Of friends&#8212;some known to as and some unknown&#8212;</p>
<p>Many veiled messages of love and praise.</p>
<p>The floorways of the long basilica</p>
<p>Fronted us with an angry multitude;</p>
<p>And scornful eyes and threatening foreheads frowned</p>
<p>In hundreds from the columned galleries.</p>
<p>We were placed all together at the bar,</p>
<p>And though at first unsteadied and confused</p>
<p>By the imperial presence of the law,</p>
<p>The pomp of judgment and the staring crowd,</p>
<p>None failed or faltered; with unshaken tongue</p>
<p>Each met the stern Proconsul's brief demand</p>
<p>In clear profession. Rapt as in a dream,</p>
<p>Scarce conscious of my turn, nor how I spake,</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;88]</span>
<p>I watched with wondering eyes the delicate face</p>
<p>And figure of Perpetua; for her</p>
<p>We that were youngest of our company</p>
<p>Loved with a sacred and absorbing love,</p>
<p>A passion that our martyr's brotherly vow</p>
<p>Had purified and made divine. She stood</p>
<p>In dreamy contemplation, slightly bowed,</p>
<p>A glowing stillness that was near a smile</p>
<p>Upon her soft closed lips. Her turn had come,</p>
<p>When, like a puppet struggling up the steps,</p>
<p>Her father from the pierced and swaying crowd</p>
<p>Appeared, unveiling in his agèd arms</p>
<p>The smiling visage of her babe. He grasped</p>
<p>Her robe, and strove to draw her down. All eyes</p>
<p>Were bent upon her. With a softening glance,</p>
<p>And voice less cold and heavy with death's doom,</p>
<p>The old Proconsul turned to her and said:</p>
<p>'Lady, have pity on your father's age;</p>
<p>Be mindful of your tender babe; this grain</p>
<p>Of harmless incense offer for the peace</p>
<p>And welfare of the Emperor'; but she,</p>
<p>Lifting far forth her large and noteless eyes,</p>
<p>As one that saw a vision, only said:</p>
<p>'I cannot sacrifice'; and he, harsh tongued,</p>
<p>Bending a brow upon her rough as rock,</p>
<p>With eyes that struck like steel, seeking to break</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;89]</span>
<p>Or snare her with a sudden stroke of fear:</p>
<p>'Art thou a Christian?' and she answered, 'Yea,</p>
<p>I am a Christian!' In brow-blackening wrath</p>
<p>He motioned a contemptuous hand and bade</p>
<p>The lictors scourge the old man down and forth</p>
<p>With rods, and as the cruel deed was done,</p>
<p>Perpetua stood white with quivering lips,</p>
<p>And her eyes filled with tears. While yet his cries</p>
<p>Were mingling with the curses of the crowd,</p>
<p>Hilarianus, calling name by name,</p>
<p>Gave sentence, and in cold and formal phrase</p>
<p>Condemned us to the beasts, and we returned</p>
<p>Rejoicing to our prison. Then we wished</p>
<p>Our martyrdom could soon have followed, not</p>
<p>As doubting for our constancy, but some</p>
<p>Grew sick under the anxious long suspense.</p>
<p>Perpetua again was weighed upon</p>
<p>By grief and trouble for her babe, whom now</p>
<p>Her father, seeking to depress her will,</p>
<p>Withheld and would not send it; but at length</p>
<p>Word being brought her that the child indeed</p>
<p>No longer suffered, nor desired the breast,</p>
<p>Her peace returned, and, giving thanks to God,</p>
<p>All were united in new bonds of hope.</p>
<p>Now being fixed in certitude of death,</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;90]</span>
<p>We stripped our souls of all their earthly gear,</p>
<p>The useless raiment of this world; and thus,</p>
<p>Striving together with a single will,</p>
<p>In daily increment of faith and power,</p>
<p>We were much comforted by heavenly dreams,</p>
<p>And waking visitations of God's grace.</p>
<p>Visions of light and glory infinite</p>
<p>Were frequent with us, and by night or day</p>
<p>Woke at the very name of Christ the Lord,</p>
<p>Taken at any moment on our lips;</p>
<p>So that we had no longer thought or care</p>
<p>Of life or of the living, but became</p>
<p>As spirits from this earth already freed,</p>
<p>Scarce conscious of the dwindling weight of flesh.</p>
<p>To Saturus appeared in dreams the space</p>
<p>And splendour of the heavenly house of God,</p>
<p>The glowing gardens of eternal joy,</p>
<p>The halls and chambers of the cherubim,</p>
<p>In wreaths of endless myriads involved</p>
<p>The blinding glory of the angel choir,</p>
<p>Rolling through deeps of wheeling cloud and light</p>
<p>The thunder of their vast antiphonies.</p>
<p>The visions of Perpetua not less</p>
<p>Possessed us with their homely tenderness&#8212;</p>
<p>As one, wherein she saw a rock-set pool</p>
<p>And weeping o'er its rim a little child,</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;91]</span>
<p>Her brother, long since dead, Dinocrates:</p>
<p>Though sore athirst, he could not reach the stream,</p>
<p>Being so small, and her heart grieved thereat.</p>
<p>She looked again, and lo! the pool had risen,</p>
<p>And the child filled his goblet, and drank deep,</p>
<p>And prattling in a tender childish joy</p>
<p>Ran gaily off, as infants do, to play.</p>
<p>By this she knew his soul had found release</p>
<p>From torment, and had entered into bliss.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Quickly as by a merciful gift of God,</p>
<p>Our vigil passed unbroken. Yesternight</p>
<p>They moved us to the amphitheatre,</p>
<p>Our final lodging-place on earth, and there</p>
<p>We sat together at our agapé</p>
<p>For the last time. In silence, rapt and pale,</p>
<p>We hearkened to the aged Saturus,</p>
<p>Whose speech, touched with a ghostly eloquence,</p>
<p>Canvassed the fraud and littleness of life,</p>
<p>God's goodness and the solemn joy of death.</p>
<p>Perpetua was silent, but her eyes</p>
<p>Fell gently upon each of us, suffused</p>
<p>With inward and eradiant light; a smile</p>
<p>Played often upon her lips.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='in5em'>While yet we sat,</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;92]</span>
<p>A tribune with a band of soldiery</p>
<p>Entered our cell, and would have had us bound</p>
<p>In harsher durance, fearing our escape</p>
<p>By fraud or witchcraft; but Perpetua,</p>
<p>Facing him gently with a noble note</p>
<p>Of wonder in her voice, and on her lips</p>
<p>A lingering smile of mournful irony:</p>
<p>'Sir, are ye not unwise to harass us,</p>
<p>And rob us of our natural food and rest?</p>
<p>Should ye not rather tend us with soft care,</p>
<p>And so provide a comely spectacle?</p>
<p>We shall not honour Cæsar's birthday well,</p>
<p>If we be waste and weak, a piteous crew,</p>
<p>Poor playthings for your proud and pampered beasts.'</p>
<p>The noisy tribune, whether touched indeed,</p>
<p>Or by her grave and tender grace abashed,</p>
<p>Muttered and stormed a while, and then withdrew.</p>
<p>The short night passed in wakeful prayer for some,</p>
<p>For others in brief sleep, broken by dreams</p>
<p>And spiritual visitations. Earliest dawn</p>
<p>Found us arisen, and Perpetua,</p>
<p>Moving about with smiling lips, soft-tongued,</p>
<p>Besought us to take food; lest so, she said,</p>
<p>For all the strength and courage of our hearts,</p>
<p>Our bodies should fall faint. We heard without,</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;93]</span>
<p>Already ere the morning light was full,</p>
<p>The din of preparation, and the hum</p>
<p>Of voices gathering in the upper tiers;</p>
<p>Yet had we seen so often in our thoughts</p>
<p>The picture of this strange and cruel death,</p>
<p>Its festal horror, and its bloody pomp,</p>
<p>The nearness scarcely moved us, and our hands</p>
<p>Met in a steadfast and unshaken clasp.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>The day is over. Ah, my friend, how long</p>
<p>With its wild sounds and bloody sights it seemed!</p>
<p>Night comes, and I am still alive&#8212;even I,</p>
<p>The least and last&#8212;with other two, reserved</p>
<p>To grace to-morrow's second day. The rest</p>
<p>Have suffered and with holy rapture passed</p>
<p>Into their glory. Saturus and the men</p>
<p>Were given to bears and leopards, but the crowd</p>
<p>Feasted their eyes upon no cowering shape,</p>
<p>Nor hue of fear, nor painful cry. They died</p>
<p>Like armèd men, face foremost to the beasts,</p>
<p>With prayers and sacred songs upon their lips.</p>
<p>Perpetua and the frail Felicitas</p>
<p>Were seized before our eyes and roughly stripped,</p>
<p>And shrinking and entreating, not for fear,</p>
<p>Nor hurt, but bitter shame, were borne away</p>
<p>Into the vast arena, and hung up</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;94]</span>
<p>In nets, naked before the multitude,</p>
<p>For a fierce bull, maddened by goads, to toss.</p>
<p>Some sudden tumult of compassion seized</p>
<p>The crowd, and a great murmur like a wave</p>
<p>Rose at the sight, and grew, and thundered up</p>
<p>From tier to tier, deep and imperious:</p>
<p>So white, so innocent they were, so pure:</p>
<p>Their tender limbs so eloquent of shame;</p>
<p>And so our loved ones were brought back, all faint,</p>
<p>And covered with light raiment, and again</p>
<p>Led forth, and now with smiling lips they passed</p>
<p>Pale, but unbowed, into the awful ring,</p>
<p>Holding each other proudly by the hand.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Perpetua first was tossed, and her robe rent,</p>
<p>But, conscious only of the glaring eyes,</p>
<p>She strove to hide herself as best she could</p>
<p>In the torn remnants of her flimsy robe,</p>
<p>And putting up her hands clasped back her hair,</p>
<p>So that she might not die as one in grief,</p>
<p>Unseemly and dishevelled. Then she turned,</p>
<p>And in her loving arms caressed and raised</p>
<p>The dying, bruised Felicitas. Once more</p>
<p>Gored by the cruel beast, they both were borne</p>
<p>Swooning and mortally stricken from the field.</p>
<p>Perpetua, pale and beautiful, her lips</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;95]</span>
<p>Parted as in a lingering ecstasy,</p>
<p>Could not believe the end had come, but asked</p>
<p>When they were to be given to the beasts.</p>
<p>The keepers gathered round her&#8212;even they&#8212;</p>
<p>In wondering pity&#8212;while with fearless hand,</p>
<p>Bidding us all be faithful and stand firm,</p>
<p>She bared her breast, and guided to its goal</p>
<p>The gladiator's sword that pierced her heart.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>The night is passing. In a few short hours</p>
<p>I too shall suffer for the name of Christ.</p>
<p>A boundless exaltation lifts my soul!</p>
<p>I know that they who left us, Saturus,</p>
<p>Perpetua, and the other blessed ones,</p>
<p>Await me at the opening gates of heaven.</p>

<h3><a name='p37' id='p37'>THE WOODCUTTER'S HUT</a></h3>

<div class='poem'
style='width:35em;'>

<div class='stanza'>
<p>Far up in the wild and wintery hills in the heart of the cliff-broken woods,</p>
<p>Where the mounded drifts lie soft and deep in the noiseless solitudes,</p>
<p>The hut of the lonely woodcutter stands, a few rough beams that show</p>
<p>A blunted peak and a low black line, from the glittering waste of snow.</p>
<p>In the frost-still dawn from his roof goes up in the windless, motionless air,</p>
<p>The thin, pink curl of leisurely smoke; through the forest white and bare</p>
<p>The woodcutter follows his narrow trail, and the morning rings and cracks</p>
<p>With the rhythmic jet of his sharp-blown breath and the echoing shout of his axe.</p>
<p>Only the waft of the wind besides, or the stir of some hardy bird&#8212;</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;104]</span>
<p>The call of the friendly chickadee, or the pat of the nuthatch&#8212;is heard;</p>
<p>Or a rustle comes from a dusky clump, where the busy siskins feed,</p>
<p>And scatter the dimpled sheet of the snow with the shells of the cedar-seed.</p>
<p>Day after day the woodcutter toils untiring with axe and wedge,</p>
<p>Till the jingling teams come up from the road that runs by the valley's edge,</p>
<p>With plunging of horses, and hurling of snow, and many a shouted word,</p>
<p>And carry away the keen-scented fruit of his cutting, cord upon cord.</p>
<p>Not the sound of a living foot comes else, not a moving visitant there,</p>
<p>Save the delicate step of some halting doe, or the sniff of a prowling bear.</p>
<p>And only the stars are above him at night, and the trees that creak and groan,</p>
<p>And the frozen, hard-swept mountain-crests with their silent fronts of stone,</p>
<p>As he watches the sinking glow of his fire and the wavering flames upcaught,</p>
<p>Cleaning his rifle or mending his moccasins, sleepy and slow of thought.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;105]</span>
<p>Or when the fierce snow comes, with the rising wind, from the grey north-east,</p>
<p>He lies through the leaguering hours in his bunk like a winter-hidden beast,</p>
<p>Or sits on the hard-packed earth, and smokes by his draught-blown guttering fire,</p>
<p>Without thought or remembrance, hardly awake, and waits for the storm to tire.</p>
<p>Scarcely he hears from the rock-rimmed heights to the wild ravines below,</p>
<p>Near and far-off, the limitless wings of the tempest hurl and go</p>
<p>In roaring gusts that plunge through the cracking forest, and lull, and lift,</p>
<p>All day without stint and all night long with the sweep of the hissing drift.</p>
<p>But winter shall pass ere long with its hills of snow and its fettered dreams,</p>
<p>And the forest shall glimmer with living gold, and chime with the gushing of streams;</p>
<p>Millions of little points of plants shall prick through its matted floor,</p>
<p>And the wind-flower lift and uncurl her silken buds by the woodman's door;</p>
<p>The sparrow shall see and exult; but lo! as the spring draws gaily on,</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;106]</span>
<p>The woodcutter's hut is empty and bare, and the master that made it is gone.</p>
<p>He is gone where the gathering of valley men another labour yields,</p>
<p>To handle the plough, and the harrow, and scythe, in the heat of the summer fields.</p>
<p>He is gone with his corded arms, and his ruddy face, and his moccasined feet,</p>
<p>The animal man in his warmth and vigour, sound, and hard, and complete.</p>
<p>And all summer long, round the lonely hut, the black earth burgeons and breeds,</p>
<p>Till the spaces are filled with the tall-plumed ferns and the triumphing forest-weeds;</p>
<p>The thick wild raspberries hem its walls, and, stretching on either hand,</p>
<p>The red-ribbed stems and the giant-leaves of the sovereign spikenard stand.</p>
<p>So lonely and silent it is, so withered and warped with the sun and snow,</p>
<p>You would think it the fruit of some dead man's toil a hundred years ago;</p>
<p>And he who finds it suddenly there, as he wanders far and alone,</p>
<p>Is touched with a sweet and beautiful sense of something tender and gone,</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg.&#160;107]</span>
<p>The sense of a struggling life in the waste, and the mark of a soul's command,</p>
<p>The going and coming of vanished feet, the touch of a human hand.</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
